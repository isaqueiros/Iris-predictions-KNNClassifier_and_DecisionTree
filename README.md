# Iris-predictions-KNNClassifier_and_DecisionTree
This notebook demonstrates the basic application of two common machine learning algorithms for species classification using the classic Iris dataset. The models used are:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier

This is a beginner-friendly guide for understanding and applying basic classification techniques in Python using scikit-learn.
The model is applied to dataset Iris, which is supplied separately in .csv format.
